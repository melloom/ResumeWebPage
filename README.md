# 👋 Hey, I'm Melvin

**Full-Stack Developer** • **AI Integrator** • **Builder**

A modern, responsive portfolio that screams "I code with vision, vibes, and velocity." Built from scratch because why use a template when you can build something uniquely yours? ✨

## 🌐 Live Site

**👉 [mellowsites.com](https://mellowsites.com/)**

Check it out, break things, send feedback. I'm always down to chat.

## 🎯 What's This About?

This isn't just another portfolio site. This is my digital home—a space where I showcase:

- 💼 **My Work**: Real projects that solve real problems
- 🚀 **My Skills**: The tools I use to build things fast
- 🎨 **My Style**: Clean code, smooth animations, zero BS
- 🤝 **My Story**: Who I am, what I've done, where I'm going

Think of it as a resume that actually doesn't suck to read. Plus it's a PWA, so you can install it on your phone. Fancy, right? 📱

## ⚡ What Makes This Special?

## 🛠️ The Tech Stack (The Good Stuff)

I'm not here to flex, but this stack is solid:

- **React 18.2** - Because hooks are life
- **Vite 6.3** - The build tool that makes Webpack cry
- **Firebase** - Backend as a service done right
- **Framer Motion** - Animations that don't make your laptop sound like a jet
- **React Router** - Routing that actually makes sense
- **EmailJS** - Contact forms without the backend headache
- **PWA Plugin** - Offline-first, installable, modern web app

**Styling?** CSS Modules + SASS + custom CSS variables. No framework bloat, just clean, maintainable styles.

---

## 🚀 Quick Start (Let's Build Something)

### Prerequisites

You'll need:
- **Node.js** 14+ (but let's be real, use 18+)
- **npm** or **yarn** (your call)
- **Git** (obviously)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone this bad boy
git clone https://github.com/melloom/ResumeWebPage.git
cd ResumeWebPage

# Install the dependencies
npm install

# Set up your environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Then edit .env with your actual keys (see below)

# Start the dev server
npm run dev
```

Boom. Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) and watch the magic happen. ✨

### Environment Variables

You'll need to set these up in your `.env` file:

```env
# Firebase (get these from Firebase Console)
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_key_here
VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_project.firebaseapp.com
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_project.firebasestorage.app
VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_sender_id
VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id
VITE_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID=your_measurement_id

# EmailJS (get these from EmailJS dashboard)
VITE_EMAILJS_PUBLIC_KEY=your_public_key
VITE_EMAILJS_SERVICE_ID=your_service_id
```

**⚠️ Important:** Never commit your `.env` file. It's in `.gitignore` for a reason. Trust me on this one.

## 🎨 Customization (Make It Yours)

### Personal Info

1. **Experience & Education**: Edit `src/data/experienceData.js` and `src/data/educationData.js`
2. **Projects**: Add your own in `src/components/projects/ProjectList/ProjectList.jsx`
3. **Profile Images**: Drop your pics in `public/images/`
4. **Screenshots**: Add project thumbnails to `public/screenshots/`

### Styling

- **Colors**: Edit CSS variables in `src/index.css`
- **Fonts**: Update imports in `index.html`
- **Components**: Each component has its own CSS module - go wild

### Features

Want to add something? Fork it, build it, make it better. That's the beauty of open source.

---

## 🚢 Deployment (Get It Live)

### Netlify (Recommended - It's What I Use)

1. Push to GitHub
2. Connect repo to Netlify
3. Set build command: `npm run build`
4. Set publish directory: `dist`
5. Add environment variables in Netlify dashboard
6. Deploy. Done.

### Vercel

Same process, different platform. You do you.

### GitHub Pages

Possible but requires some config tweaks. Not recommended unless you're into that.

---

## 📝 Scripts

```bash
npm run dev      # Start dev server (port 3000)

npm run push     # Build, commit, push, and deploy (one command FTW)
```
